# SpecSenseAI: AI-Powered Product Specification Analysis

[](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
[](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

An intelligent web application designed to analyze product specifications from images. SpecSenseAI leverages Gemini's generative AI to extract, interpret, and present key technical details from uploaded specification sheets, datasheets, or product labels.

## About The Project

SpecSenseAI solves the problem of manually sifting through dense technical documents. By simply uploading an image of a specification sheet, users can get an instant, easy-to-read summary of the product's key attributes. This tool is perfect for engineers, procurement specialists, and tech enthusiasts who need to quickly compare and understand product capabilities.

The core of the application is a Python backend powered by the Gemini API, which processes the image and extracts the relevant information. A clean, user-friendly frontend built with [mention your frontend framework, e.g., Streamlit, Flask, React] allows for easy interaction.

## Key Features

  * **Image-to-Text Extraction**: Upload an image (PNG, JPG, etc.) of a spec sheet.
  * **AI-Powered Analysis**: Utilizes Google's Gemini to intelligently parse and understand the extracted text.
  * **Structured Output**: Presents the specifications in a clear, organized format (e.g., JSON, Markdown table).
  * **Web Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for uploading images and viewing results.
  * **Scalable Backend**: Built with a robust Python framework to handle requests efficiently.

## Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern technology stack:

  * **Backend**: Python
  * **AI Model**: Google Gemini API
  * **Web Framework**: [e.g., Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit]
  * **Frontend**: [e.g., HTML/CSS/JS, Streamlit, or a framework like React/Vue]
  * **Dependencies**:
      * `google-generativeai`
      * `Pillow` (for image processing)
      * [Add other key libraries like `Flask`, `gunicorn`, `python-dotenv`]

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.9 or higher
  * A Google Gemini API Key. You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/).
  * `pip` for installing Python packages.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/vaibhavd039/SpecSenseAI.git
    cd SpecSenseAI
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```sh
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**

      * Create a file named `.env` in the root directory.
      * Add your Gemini API key to this file:
        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the application:**

    ```sh
    # If using Streamlit
    streamlit run app.py

    # If using Flask
    flask run
    ```

2.  **Open your browser:**
    Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8501` (for Streamlit) or `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (for Flask).

3.  **Upload an Image:**
    Click the "Upload" button and select an image file containing product specifications.

4.  **Get Results:**
    The application will process the image and display the extracted specifications in a structured format.
